This voting dApp has been created following Dapp University's tutorial.
Multiple issues were encountered along the way since this tutorial was made a year ago.

- Solidity >0.5.0 was used
- Ganache was not used, instead Truffle development blockchain was prefered
- function Constructor() were replaced by constructor()
- Storage and memory location had to be specified
- emit invocation had to be added before calling the event function

Most issues were pointed out by the Solidity plugin on VS Code.
If anyone ever encounter this, I highly recommend doing the CryptoZombies introduction to Solidity before.
